# TaskManager-Lite

This is a task mannager for those rare situations where the built-in windows task manager won't do.
Some reasons why this may be good for you are the following:
 
 * If you are in charge of monitoring a group of computers, and you still want your clients to be able to close tasks, but not your monitoring software.
 * If you, or someone you know, has broken Windows badly enough that their normal task manager won't work.
 * Or perhaps using it as a task manager for wine on linux. (untested)
